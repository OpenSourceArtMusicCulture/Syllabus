Attendance:

Students are expected always to be present during class and recitations. Excellence in submitted work will not make up for delinquency in attendance. More than three unexcused absences will result in a lowering of your final course grade by one mark. More than eight absences will result in the failure of the course. If you must miss a class, assignments are due before the class period begins. Excusable absences include illness, family emergencies, and scheduled Rensselaer athletic events. 
Academic Integrity:

Student-teacher relationships should be built on trust. Students should be able to trust that teachers have made responsible decisions about the structure and content of the courses they teach, and teachers must trust that the assignments students turn in are their own. Acts that violate this trust undermine the educational enterprise and contradict the very reason for your being at Rensselaer. The Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities defines various forms of academic dishonesty and procedures for responding to them. The policies laid out in the Handbook are intended to maintain a community of trust and will be strictly enforced. Please review these policies. 
For this course, the following penalties will apply: 
•	Significant acts of plagiarism (e.g., text copied verbatim from an unidentified  source): Failure of the course and a written judgment in the student’s official record  
•	Minor acts of plagiarism (e.g., referencing the findings of others without  appropriate citations): Failure of the assignment, plus reduction of final course  grade by one letter grade  
•	Other acts of academic dishonesty: Penalties range from a warning to reduction of  final grade by one letter grade to failure of the course, depending on the severity of the violation as determined by the instructor  As is evident above, penalties for plagiarism are significant. All direct use of another person’s words must be placed inside quotation marks. You must also indicate where you paraphrase another’s work and where you borrow another’s specific ideas or interpretations. If you have questions regarding proper citation practices, see the instructor for clarification before the assignment is submitted.  While collaboration is encouraged throughout the course, others cannot do work for you. All assignment activities must be carried out by the individual or team members submitting the assignment for a grade. Other people may show you how to do something (say, when using computer software), but you must follow up by doing the work yourself.  The Rensselaer Handbook provides specific procedures by which a student may appeal a grade. You should speak to the professor before initiating an appeal. If this does not lead to satisfactory resolution, you have the option of appealing your grade by writing to the head of the STS Department no later than 10 days after your grade has been posted.
